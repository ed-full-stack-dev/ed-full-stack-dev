👋 Hi, I’m @ed-full-stack-dev
👀 I’m interested in creating efficient, user-friendly websites and exploring the latest in web development technologies. I have a particular passion for React and enjoy using it to bring dynamic web projects to life.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced state management techniques in React and exploring the use of progressive web apps (PWAs) to enhance user experience.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that focus on educational tools or platforms that help small businesses optimize their online presence.
